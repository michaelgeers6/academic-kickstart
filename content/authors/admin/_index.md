# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a doctoral student at the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin working jointly with Ralph Hertwig and Stefan Herzog. I am also a fellow of the International Max Planck Research School on the Life Course (LIFE).

My research is primarily examining online misinformation and microtargeting from a cognitive perspective. To this end, I investigate how the human mind grapples with these novel digital challenges. Ultimately, I hope this research will motivate interventions aimed at promoting more reflected and autonomous online behaviors.
